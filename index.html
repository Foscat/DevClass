        And as pizza worked its way into the hearts 
        of Americans, Americans made pizza a
        surprisingly significant part of their own
        matters of the heart. Of the participants
        who dated online, three in five said they
        would swipe right or match with someone who
        mentioned pizza in a dating profile. But the
        follow-through is just as important; 22
        percent said if their date ate pizza with a
        knife and fork, they would not agree to a
        second date.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Could pizza be the answer to our divided
        country? That remains to be seen. Until the,
        we should all raise a slice to the prospect
        of a better, cheesier tomorrow. Just donâ€™t
        get us started on the thin crust vs. deep
        dish debate.

       With brain imaging, the effects of regular TV viewing on a child's neural circuits are plain to see. Studies suggest watching television for prolonged periods changes the anatomical structure of a child's brain and lowers verbal abilities. Behaviorally, even more detrimental effects may exist: although a cause-and-effect relation is hard to prove, higher rates of antisocial behavior, obesity and mental health problems correlate with hours in front of the set.

        Now a new study hits the pause button on this line of thinking. The researchers conclude that the entire body of research up to now has overlooked an important confounding variable, heredity, that could call into question the conventional wisdom that TV is bad for the brain. Further study will be needed to evaluate this claim, but the combined evidence suggests we need a more nuanced attitude toward our viewing habits.
